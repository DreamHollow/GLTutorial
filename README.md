# GLTutorial
A tutorial repository for practicing OpenGL.

There are no special notes or warnings for this project.
It would be extremely helpful for you to know how to install and use GLFW, as well as other suggested tools in order for this project to work properly.

Because this project closely follows the exact same code and implementations as JoeyDeVries "OpenGL" website, it will also be using a very similar "creative commons" license in attribution.
